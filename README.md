# Java Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Personally, I have started solving Sudoku puzzles since the age of 5. Being a Sudoku lover, I often find it frustrating when I am unable to solve the puzzle by myself, using simple Sudoku technqiues I had picked up along the way, including scanning, elimination and using Naked Pairs.

Inspired by my love for Sudoku, I decided to create this Sudoku solver application, using the Backtracking Algorithm to test out my programming knowledge and combine my love for Sudoku - the best of both worlds for me.

Enjoy this simple Java application created by me to solve Sudoku with ease!
